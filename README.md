# The 95 Theses of Covenant Finance

**Nailed to the Digital Door of the Modern Church of Crypto**

> *Out of love for the truth and a desire to bring it to light, the following propositions on the failures of "trustless" finance and the foundation of Covenant Finance will be debated and declared.*

## The Mission

For too long, the cryptocurrency movement has operated under hollow slogans that sound revolutionary but deliver tyranny. "Code is Law." "Trustless Systems." "Be Your Own Bank." These phrases have become weapons of manipulation, obscuring the truth and enslaving those who seek freedom.

**The 95 Theses of Covenant Finance** is a declaration against these hollow promises and a foundation for true economic sovereignty rooted in covenant principles.

## The Structure

The theses are organized into seven parts:

1. **Foundation (1-15)**: The Philosophical Bankruptcy of Modern Crypto
2. **Language (16-30)**: Cleansing the Corrupted Definitions
3. **Technical (31-45)**: Exposing the False Idols of Technique
4. **Economic (46-60)**: Unmasking Financial Manipulation
5. **Community (61-75)**: Restoring Right Relationships
6. **Sovereignty (76-90)**: True Freedom vs. False Autonomy
7. **Covenant (91-95)**: The Way Forward

## The Format

Each thesis follows a consistent pattern:

- **The Hollow Slogan**: What crypto says
- **The Lie**: What it actually means
- **The Covenant Truth**: The real principle
- **The Result**: What changes when covenant truth is applied

## The Design

This is not just a document - it is a **digital monument**. The design embodies three principles:

1. **Readability as Reverence**: The text is sacred; the design elevates it
2. **Sovereign Aesthetic**: No external dependencies, all self-hosted
3. **Tactile Digitality**: Feels like unrolling a weighty, important scroll

## Viewing the Theses

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process, no dependencies, no tracking scripts. This is a sovereign document.

## Sharing

Each thesis includes a "Nail It" button that allows you to share it on social media or copy it to your clipboard. When someone says "Code is Law," link them to Thesis #1. When someone says "Trustless," link them to Thesis #2.

**This becomes the reference standard for covenant finance language.**

## The Technology Stack

## Acknowledgments

Built with support from the Liberty Through Truth Foundation community. This manifesto stands on the shoulders of Martin Luther's 95 Theses, which sparked the Protestant Reformation by exposing the corruption of indulgences and calling the church back to scriptural truth.

**We are doing the same for the modern church of crypto.**
